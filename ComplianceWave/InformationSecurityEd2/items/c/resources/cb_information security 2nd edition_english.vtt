00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:04.800
[Music]

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:15.600
What should I do?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.133
I am in a situation where I
must choose between admitting

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.767
a mistake I made which makes
me kind of uncomfortable

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:22.600
or concealing the error

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.400
which might put our
organization at risk.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.867
I wonder if you have ever been
in a comparable position?

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:30.934
It can happen to a lot of us.

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.800
Here is the situation.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.400
I don't want to carry around
two separate cell phones,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.467
so I decided to put some
of my work information

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.100
on my personal cell phone,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.934
things like my work email,
client contact information

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:44.333
and important documents
that I use frequently.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.400
This has made my
work-life much easier.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.200
So the other day while waiting
on a client for a meeting

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.700
I decided to download
an app for fun,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.233
but as soon as I had
done so I realized

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:58.033
that by agreeing to the
terms of use I provided

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:01.266
my consent for the app to access
all of the data on my phone

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:05.233
including all of my
organization's information.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:06.467
Now I am wondering,

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.300
do I report this since it
is my personal phone

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.200
and possibly get
myself into trouble

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.934
for exposing our
organization's information

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:15.734
or do I not say anything,

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.200
hoping that there is no
data stolen from my phone,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.600
knowing that doing so puts
the organization at risk?

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.500
I am nervous and
not sure what to do!

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.734
As it turned out, once
I thought things through,

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.533
the solution became clear.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.800
Maybe hearing about my
decision-making process

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.600
might help you in a
similar situation.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:40.734
The issue at hand is information
security, which has to do

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.900
with the steps we take
to protect electronic

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.633
and physical information,

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:45.934
as well as to
ensure the integrity

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.233
of our technology systems.

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:51.734
Given the amount of sensitive
and valuable information

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:53.433
I have stored on my laptop,

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:56.133
including both personally
identifiable information

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:59.000
and our organization's
intellectual property,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.567
I know it's important to protect
against security breaches.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:06.467
Without taking adequate measures
to protect against them,

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:07.767
my organization and I both

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.900
become vulnerable
to unauthorized

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.100
individuals who may steal,
modify, disclose

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.967
or even destroy valuable information.

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:20.166
Information security requires
being constantly vigilant

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.100
to those trying to compromise
our systems and data.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.367
Examples include
social engineers

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.467
or people trying
to manipulate us

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.934
into divulging
confidential information

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:33.834
or allowing unauthorized
access to our systems.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.166
This could be a
caller pretending

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:37.333
to be someone in a
position of authority

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.500
or someone you think you
can trust sending you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.100
an email encouraging you
to download new software.

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:46.900
In the latter situation
this phishing email

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.133
may contain downloads

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.467
and links infected
with malware or viruses,

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:53.867
programs designed to gather
usernames and passwords,

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:55.133
destroy content,

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.700
steal trade secrets or
even lock systems

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.600
in exchange for ransom.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.834
We should always be alert to
anyone attempting to gain

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:06.033
access to our systems,
data or facilities.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:08.633
Even when our devices are locked,
experienced hackers

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:09.834
can enter systems

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.734
if they have physical
access and enough time.

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:16.867
In unsecured public settings
such as airports, hotels,

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:19.934
restaurants or coffee shops
unscrupulous actors

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:21.767
can create fake hotspots

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.667
and use them to
hack into personal accounts

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:26.767
to track key strokes, steal
data or inject malware

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.333
or viruses into our computers.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.834
Consequences of these
actions can be severe

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:34.800
and can range from
loss of time, money

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.166
and productivity to
loss of credibility

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:41.133
and competitive advantage
to legal liability.

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:45.266
Steps that we can take to
maintain information security

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:48.100
include making timely system
updates and routinely

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.900
running preapproved
antivirus applications,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.166
only downloading items
from trusted sources,

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.567
locking computer, laptop

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:59.066
and phone screens when
they are not in use.

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:02.333
Using complex passwords and
changing them regularly,

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:03.533
keeping passwords private,

00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:05.567
never leaving
devices unattended

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:08.066
and encrypting confidential
information sent by email.

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:14.133
And if you encounter a suspected
or confirmed security breach,

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.934
you should report it to the
IT department immediately

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:18.500
so it can be
addressed right away.

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:23.166
In summary, protecting
information security means

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:26.033
knowing what it is, knowing
the steps to take to prevent

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.367
a breach of our systems

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.467
and promptly reporting
security breaches

00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:32.333
or concerns to the
IT department.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.867
Going back to the situation
involving downloading the app

00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:41.900
on my personal cell phone, it's
probably evident that I decided

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.400
that I needed to inform someone
in our organization of

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.500
what I had done.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.166
Although I was embarrassed
about admitting

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:50.734
how careless I had been,

00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:52.934
I knew that I had to tell
our IT department

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:54.066
so they could take measures

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:56.700
to minimize the risks of our
organization's information

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.367
falling into the
wrong hands.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.000
I feel much better now
and I hope you do too!

00:05:05.533 --> 00:05:07.867
If you have any questions
about information security

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.734
or other compliance issues,
please contact our IT

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:12.467
or Compliance department.

00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:15.834
They can provide expert guidance
in all kinds of situations.

00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:17.734
