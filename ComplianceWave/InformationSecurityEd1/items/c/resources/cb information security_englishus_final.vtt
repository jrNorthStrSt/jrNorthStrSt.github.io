00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:11.720
[Music]

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.770
Have you ever been
in a situation

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.820
where getting something
done urgently meant

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.970
that you were unable to follow
a policy or procedure precisely?

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.590
This kind of conflict is common
and it can be very stressful

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.840
as we struggle
to make the best decision.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.130
Imagine you are contacted

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.810
by a colleague
in another department

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.700
who claims to be working
with one of our executives.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.590
The colleague says that the
executive has become flustered

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.060
and cannot locate credentials
for an online system

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.760
that she knows
you have access to.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.170
Do you act like the hero
and provide your credentials,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.480
knowing very well that doing

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.980
so could violate our information
security policies

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.290
or do you refer the colleague
to our IT Department,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.630
knowing that it may cause
the executive time,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.730
and that you may be perceived
as having been unhelpful?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.000
It can feel like
you’re being pulled

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.600
in two different directions.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.220
The good news is that by the end
of this brief video,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.540
you’ll have the tools
to confidently

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.340
make the right choices
for both yourself

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.460
and for the company avoid,
potential disciplinary action

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.230
and feel a whole lot better
in the process.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.220
The first step to understanding
Information Security

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.820
is being able to define it.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.250
Information Security
or "InfoSec", relates to the steps

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.380
we take to protect electronic
and physical information,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.390
as well as ensure the integrity
of our technology systems.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.930
Consider for a minute just
how much sensitive information

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.650
we have on our systems -

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.380
like financial details,
health information,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.810
personally identifiable
information, trade secrets,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.410
and other
intellectual property.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.780
Without security
measures, our organization

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.950
becomes vulnerable
to data breaches

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.430
where unauthorized people
can access, modify, disclose

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.550
or even destroy
our valuable information.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.880
Once we understand

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.090
the definition
of Information Security,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.450
the next step is to be alert

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.300
to those trying to compromise
our systems and data.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.670
Examples include
"social engineers"

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.340
who are people
trying to manipulate us

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.720
into divulging
confidential information

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.080
or allowing unauthorized
access to our systems.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.800
This could be a caller
pretending to be someone

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.240
in a position of authority

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.670
or someone you think you should
trust sending you an email

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.719
encouraging you
to download new software.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.240
In the latter situation
this "phishing" email

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.180
may contain downloads
and links infected

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.970
with what’s called "malware",
like viruses and trojans,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.910
maliciously designed
to gather usernames

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.390
and passwords, destroy content,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.480
steal trade secrets,
or even lock systems for ransom.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.700
We should always be alert to
anyone attempting to gain access

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.300
to our system or facilities.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.730
Even when our devices are locked,
an experienced hacker

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.880
can enter systems if they have
physical access and enough time.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.380
Be sure to contact
building security immediately

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.940
if you notice any person, whether
an employee or a stranger,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.540
in any unauthorized area.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.540
Finally, to ensure information
security,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.540
we all must TAKE SPECIFIC
PRECAUTIONS such as:

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.530
Make timely system updates
and routinely

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.780
run pre-approved
anti-virus applications

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.590
as instructed by
our IT department.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.480
Only download items
from trusted sources.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.860
Lock computer, laptop
and phone screens

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.460
when they are not in use.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.770
Always create unique passwords
that are easy to remember

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.570
but difficult
for others to guess,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.380
incorporating a variety
of lower and uppercase letters,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.060
numbers and symbols,
with at least eight characters.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.470
Never give your passwords
to anyone without first

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.170
consulting with our
IT Department.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.720
Never leave devices unattended
or in public view

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.370
and report instances of theft
to IT immediately.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.260
Never send confidential
information via email

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.030
or instant message.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.040
Always use Virtual Private
Networking or VPN

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.050
instead of using any unsecure or
possibly dangerous public Wi-Fi.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.000
And of course, immediately
report any suspected data breach

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.380
to our IT, security,
or compliance departments,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.880
no matter how insignificant
you think it might be.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.380
In summary, the key
is to understand

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.510
what information security is.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.180
Stay alert to those trying
to breach our systems

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.830
and take all
of the safety precautions,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.430
outlined by our IT Department.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.230
Three simple steps to ensuring
information and system security.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.060
Going back to the situation

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.310
involving the phone call
from your colleague,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.660
it’s now probably pretty clear

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.860
that you can’t provide your
credentials for the executive.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.540
In the short run, it may feel
like you didn’t help the team

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.150
in a moment of need,
but in the long run,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.280
you’ll avoid the consequences
of violating company policy.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.920
Our information security
will remain strong,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.330
and your colleagues
will recognize

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.610
that you are a person
who does the right thing,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.509
even when it seems
difficult to do so.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.999
Now, doesn’t that make you
feel better already?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.790
If you have any questions
about Information Security

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.040
or other compliance issues,
please contact

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.200
our IT or Compliance Department.
We are here to help!

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.830
